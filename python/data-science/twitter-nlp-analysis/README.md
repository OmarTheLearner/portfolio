# üß† **Natural Language Processing & Topic Modeling on Twitter Data**

This project focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Topic Modeling** using **Twitter data**. The goal is to analyze tweets collected on Twitter to uncover hidden topics, identify trends, and understand public sentiment. This is achieved by preprocessing the text data, applying feature extraction techniques, and employing unsupervised machine learning algorithms to discover underlying topics in the text.

### üöÄ **Project Overview**

Social media platforms like **Twitter** are powerful tools for individuals and organizations to express opinions and share information. As the volume of user-generated content grows, extracting meaningful insights from this data becomes critical. 

In this project, we use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Topic Modeling** techniques to:

- Analyze a large corpus of **tweets** related to a specific topic
- Extract meaningful **topics** from the data using algorithms like **K-means**, **LDA**, **DBSCAN**, and **fuzzy c-means**
- Explore public sentiment and uncover patterns in **trending topics** on Twitter

The project includes:
1. **Data Collection**: Using Kaggle datasets to gather Twitter data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data by removing non-English words, stop words, case folding, and stemming.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Transforming the text data into numerical features using techniques like **TF-IDF** or **transformers**.
4. **Topic Modeling**: Using **unsupervised learning models** to identify topics within the dataset.
5. **Visualization and Insights**: Interpreting the results through meaningful graphs and visualizations.
