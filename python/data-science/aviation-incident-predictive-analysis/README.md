✈️ **Aviation Safety Prediction Models**

This project explores how **data-driven insights** and **machine learning models** can improve **aviation safety**. It leverages a variety of economic, geographical, and aviation-related factors to build models that predict accident-prone regions and enhance safety measures.

---

❓ **Questions Addressed**

- What role do economic indicators (e.g., air traffic, tech exports, GDP) **play in aviation safety?
- Can data-driven insights help predict accident-prone regions and improve safety measures?
- What are the global and regional trends in aviation accidents?
- How do geographic conditions (e.g., terrain, climate) contribute to accident frequency?

🧠 **Models Used**

- **XGBoost Model**
- **LightGBM Model**
- **Random Forest Model**

These models were trained using various **aviation safety-related data** that includes economic indicators, geographic conditions, and accident trends. They help identify patterns and predict accident-prone regions to improve aviation safety.

📊 **Key Insights**

- **Economic indicators** such as **air traffic**, **tech exports**, and **GDP** were found to correlate with **accident frequency** in certain regions.
- **Geographic conditions**, including **terrain** and **climate**, were significant factors in accident occurrence, with **mountainous regions** and **extreme weather** areas being more prone to accidents.
- **Data-driven models** helped identify **high-risk regions** that can be targeted for improved **aviation safety measures**.
